React Form Card

This project is about a form with several input fields оф different types. Most of them have validation and are required.
If you try to submit the form and some of the fields are not filled in correctly you will not have the chance to submit it. Also you will receive the error message for every single field that is not filled in correctly. When the form is submitted the values of the fields are send to bin service (piperdream - https://eo45qenxpc7qs2m.m.pipedream.net).
